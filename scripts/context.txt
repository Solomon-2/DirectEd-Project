**Our Story & Mission:**
Praxis was founded by Solomon Nderitu and Benson Mose. The idea came from a frustrating search for a local cobbler to repair a beloved pair of leather boots, only to find the last one had retired. This highlighted a larger problem: foundational craft skills are disappearing, leading to a culture of disposable, mass-produced goods. Praxis was created to reverse this trend. Our mission is to be a community-driven platform that preserves and shares the art of craftsmanship, connecting master artisans with people eager to learn, repair, and create. We want to ensure traditional skills are passed down through generations and promote a circular economy.

**Our Founders:**
- Solomon Nderitu: CEO & Co-Founder. A former product designer with a passion for sustainable craftsmanship.
- Benson Mose: Head of Artisan Relations. A fourth-generation tailor dedicated to preserving traditional techniques.

**Our Products & Services:**
1.  **Trade-in-a-Box Kits:** Comprehensive, high-quality kits for learning crafts like leatherworking. Each kit includes professional tools, materials, and access to HD video tutorials for beginners and experienced crafters alike.
2.  **Artisan Marketplace:** A curated online marketplace where certified artisans sell durable, beautifully crafted goods. We maintain rigorous quality standards and provide branding and marketing support to our artisans.
3.  **Repair & Restoration Service:** We connect users with skilled artisans for high-quality repairs on items like shoes, bags, and clothing.
